			<h1> Best Pizza, Best Value </h1>
			<p>	Southborough house of pizza is the best place. It always serves the freshest food at more than fair prices. It started out in a small location with only ten seats—one table with four chairs and six stools at a counter. Due to its quick popularity and success, it was necessary to move to the present location, in the town’s Old Fire Station in 1984. The founders renovated the Old Fire Station, keeping its original look and feel, preserving its place in the town’s history. Now in its third generation, the Baltas Family continues to own and operate Southborough House of Pizza, involving themselves in many town events and charities.
